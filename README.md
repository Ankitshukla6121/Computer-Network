###  Computer Networks 

---

#### **1. Introduction to Computer Networks**
- **Definition**: A system of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources.
- **Importance**: Enables resource sharing, communication, and data transfer.
- **Types of Networks**:
  - **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Small scale (e.g., Bluetooth).
  - **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Covers a small geographical area (e.g., office network).
  - **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers large geographical areas (e.g., the internet).
  - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a city or town.
- **Topologies**: Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid.

#### **2. OSI and TCP/IP Models**
- **OSI Model (7 Layers)**:
  1. Physical: Transmission of raw bits (e.g., cables, hubs).
  2. Data Link: Error detection and framing (e.g., Ethernet).
  3. Network: Routing and addressing (e.g., IP).
  4. Transport: Reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP, UDP).
  5. Session: Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
  6. Presentation: Data translation and encryption.
  7. Application: Interfaces for end-users (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
- **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**:
  1. Link Layer (Physical and Data Link).
  2. Internet Layer (Network).
  3. Transport Layer (Transport).
  4. Application Layer (Session, Presentation, Application).

#### **3. Networking Devices**
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN.
- **Router**: Directs data packets between networks.
- **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all connected devices.
- **Bridge**: Connects two LAN segments.
- **Modem**: Converts digital signals to analog for transmission over telephone lines.

#### **4. IP Addressing and Subnetting**
- **IP Address**: Unique identifier for a device on a network.
  - IPv4: 32-bit (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  - IPv6: 128-bit (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Subnetting**:
  - Dividing a network into smaller sub-networks.
  - **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: Notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

---

#### **5. Data Transmission**
- **Transmission Modes**:
  - Simplex: One-way communication.
  - Half-Duplex: Two-way communication, one at a time.
  - Full-Duplex: Two-way simultaneous communication.
- **Transmission Media**:
  - Wired: Twisted Pair, Coaxial Cable, Fiber Optics.
  - Wireless: Radio Waves, Infrared, Microwave.

#### **6. Protocols**
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web browsing.
- **FTP/SFTP**: File transfer.
- **SMTP/IMAP/POP3**: Email protocols.
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP**: Assigns IP addresses dynamically.
- **SNMP**: Network monitoring and management.

---

#### **7. Network Security**
- **Threats**: Malware, Phishing, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- **Encryption**: Secures data in transit (e.g., TLS/SSL).
- **Firewalls**: Filters incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **VPN**: Secures remote access.
- **IDS/IPS**: Detects and prevents intrusions.

---

#### **8. Emerging Trends in Networking**
- **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**: Centralized network management.
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Network of physical devices.
- **5G Technology**: High-speed wireless communication.
- **Network Virtualization**: Abstracting network resources.
